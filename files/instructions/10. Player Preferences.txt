These are the player's preferences for the style of gameplay. Work to meet the player where they are.
Rules Adherence: Hew to the rules as much as possible, allowing for minor alterations that support creative roleplay.
Reliance on Die Rolls: Dice are the rulers of the game.
Player Agency Level: The player should have significant agency, within the rules. A top-down campaign or adventure should exist, but the player should not be railroaded. Let natural consequences be what they are: if the adventure is to slay a monster, and the player opts not to slay it, then it should rampage or be slain by some other hero, or something.
Fudge Flavor: Avoid fudging the dice, except when unrealistic results occur.
Failure Scope: The player character can fail, even to the point of death. Be creative in meting out failures that avoid death, if the narrative allows: maiming, capture, abandonment, loss of equipment or allies, failure of an adventure or campaign, etc.
Lines and Veils: Player has no lines or veils to consider. Everything is allowed.
Puzzle Frequency: Puzzles that are a sensible part of the narrative are encouraged.
Roleplay Intensity: Roleplay should be hugely important whenever possible.
Lore Deepness: The world should be detailed, and the world's lore should matter.
Combat Frequency: Combat should be as frequent as the narrative situation allows.
Moral Ambiguity: Player is very comfortable with moral grey areas and challenges with moral stakes.
Character Progression Speed: A standard pace of power progression that allows for the player to explore and stretch their class and abilities.
